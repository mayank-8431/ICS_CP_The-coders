##Equation Solver Program in C
This program allows solving different types of equations, including a pair of linear equations, quadratic equations, linear equations, and three linear equations in three variables.

##Prerequisites
C Compiler: Ensure you have a C compiler installed to compile and run the program. For example, GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) can be used.


##Features
Pair of Linear Equations: Determines the solutions or if there are infinitely many/no solutions for the given pair of equations.
Quadratic Equation: Computes the roots of the quadratic equation (real, repeated real, or complex).
Linear Equation: Finds the solution of a linear equation or identifies if it has no solution or infinite solutions.
Three Linear Equations in Three Variables: Solves a system of three linear equations and displays the values of x, y, and z if solutions exist.


##Select Equation Type:
Follow the on-screen instructions to select the type of equation you want to solve and input the required coefficients or values.

##Exit the Program:
To exit the program, select option 5 when prompted.

##Usage Instructions:
Pair of Linear Equations (a1x + b1y + c1 = 0 and a2x + b2y + c2 = 0):
Input coefficients a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2 for the two equations.


Quadratic Equation (ax^2 + bx + c = 0):
Enter coefficients a, b, c for the quadratic equation.


Linear Equation (ax + b = 0):
Input the coefficient 'a' and constant term 'b' for the linear equation.


Three Linear Equations in Three Variables:
Provide coefficients in the form of a 3x3 matrix and constants as a 3x1 matrix.


##Program Flow
The program presents a menu to choose the type of equation to solve. It prompts for input based on the selected equation type and provides solutions or specific messages depending on the input.
